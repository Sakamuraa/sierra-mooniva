/**
 * The next stream.
 *
 * Kept apart from the broadcast cards on purpose. A live card says "now" and a
 * finished one says "then"; this says "not yet", and rendering it as one more
 * tile in the same grid would blur exactly the distinction it exists to make.
 *
 * No countdown. The /streams grid carries a scheduled item but not its start time
 * in anything this endpoint reads, so a ticking clock would have to be built from
 * a number that is not there. The honest thing is to link to the stream, where
 * YouTube shows the real time.
 *
 * `demoChannel` is what stops this from quietly lying. When the site has nothing
 * scheduled of its own the card shows a stream from another channel, and it names
 * that channel rather than borrowing the schedule as if it were the site's own.
 * Asked "when is the next stream" and shown a stranger's schedule unlabelled is
 * the wrong answer in a shape that looks right.
 *
 * Two colour decisions worth stating, both of which were wrong first:
 *
 * The wash over the thumbnail is a literal ink, not a token. --fg and
 * --surface-deep both flip between themes here, so a wash built on either would
 * lighten the image in one theme and darken it in the other. An overlay's only
 * job is to darken, so it needs a colour that means the same thing in both.
 *
 * The badge is --gold on --ground, the pairing this site already uses for a
 * filled control and measures 9.6:1 -- the same figure the primary button relies
 * on, so the two cannot drift apart if the palette is retuned.
