/**
 * A single broadcast, with the video and the chat beside it.

 * the way it is:
 *
 * - The player is YouTube's own /embed, fetched by the visitor's browser, not by
 *   the server. Measured: 200, 147 KB, no bot wall. The watch page is walled from
 *   a serverless IP but /embed is built for third-party use, so the one surface
 *   that is reachable is the one that matters here.
 *
 * - Chat goes through `/api/chat`, which builds its own message cursor instead of
 *   reusing the one in the watch page. That cursor is an invalidation token, and
 *   posting it back returns 200 with zero messages, which reads exactly like a
 *   quiet chat. Building one from the video and channel id returns real messages.
 *   It still only exists while a stream is running: an archived broadcast has no
 *   chat at all, so the panel names that case rather than showing an empty log.
