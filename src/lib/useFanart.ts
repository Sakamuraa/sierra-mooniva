 * request and the rest behind a cursor, so the endpoint walks a few pages itself
 * and returns a cursor for the remainder -- without it this page showed four
 * pictures out of the hundred-odd that exist. `loadMore` follows that cursor on
 * demand rather than the hook walking everything up front, because each page is a
 * separate request to an instance that rate-limits hard.

 * transient error should not turn a wall of artwork into a wall of text.
