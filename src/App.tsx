 * Page composition, and the routing that chooses it.
 *
 * Eleven routes, one bundle. The router is a table lookup rather than a library:
 * no nesting, no loaders, no params, so a dependency would be more machinery
 * than the routing itself.
 *
 *   /                  Hero, Profile, Uploads (24h window), Channels
 *   /tentang           Profile, with the full detail this page has room for
 *   /konten            Broadcast list
 *   /konten/streams    One broadcast: player and live chat
 *   /konten/video      Uploads that are not broadcasts
 *   /konten/clips      Clips from other channels naming her
 *   /tweets            Recent posts
 *   /fanart            Art posted by other people
 *   /outfit            Outfit sheets, newest first
 *   /project           Cover songs and tournament recordings
 *   /channel           Channel links
 *
 * The route list itself is imported from content/site.ts, so the nav and the
 * router read the same table and cannot disagree about what paths exist.
