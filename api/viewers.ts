/*
 * GET /api/viewers
 *
 * The viewer count on the running broadcast, and nothing else.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than reading /api/content more often
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * /api/content answers in about a second because it fetches three YouTube tabs.
 * This one fetches a single tab and reads one number off it, so a page can ask
 * every ten seconds while somebody is live without the cost multiplying by three
 * tabs and a dozen videos.
 *
 * That cost is the whole point of keeping the two apart. /api/content carries a
 * whole archive, so its window has to be long or it scrapes YouTube constantly.
 * /api/viewers carries one integer that changes every few seconds, so its window
 * has to be short or the page is wrong. Those two requirements are incompatible
 * in one payload, and folding them together forced a choice that made one of
 * them wrong.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose
 * ------------------------
 * No imports, deliberately. Every function here is standalone because Vercel
 * transpiles each one in place -- a relative import out of api/ does not survive
 * into the deployed output. The same rule is why /api/content, /api/chat,
 * /api/tweets and /api/fanart all repeat their own parsing instead of sharing a
 * module. The duplication is the price of the deployment model, not an oversight,
 * and it is why the patterns below are copied verbatim from content.ts rather
 * than imported from it: if one drifts, this file says so.
 *
 * Cache
 * -----
 * Ten seconds while live, a minute otherwise. The asymmetry is correct here even
 * though it was wrong on /api/content: the client only polls while a broadcast is
 * running, so the quiet branch is reached at most once per page load, and it is
 * the state where nothing is changing. Note this is the opposite of the shape
 * /api/content had, where the quiet window was the long one.
 *
 * A single warm instance answers every visitor within its ten seconds, so ten
 * people refreshing together cost YouTube one fetch, not ten. That coalescing is
 * why the memory cache is here at all.
