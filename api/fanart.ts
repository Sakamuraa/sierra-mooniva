/*
 * GET /api/fanart
 *
 * Art posted by other people, found by hashtag.
 *
 * Where it comes from
 * -------------------
 * X has no anonymous way to search, and the endpoints that used to be reachable
 * now answer 429 or 401 from a serverless IP (measured, and written up in the
 * README). The same Nitter instances that serve the tweets route also serve a
 * search feed, so this reads:
 *
 *   /search/rss?f=tweets&q=%23PingGambar
 *
 * which is Nitter's own rendering of https://x.com/search?q=%23PingGambar&f=live.
 *
 * The hashtag is matched case-insensitively here as well, because people write
 * #PingGambar, #pinggambar and #PINGGAMBAR interchangeably and the search treats
 * them as one term anyway. Matching again costs nothing and catches the entries
 * a case-sensitive test would drop.
 *
 * The read is per request with no memory cache and no lastGood copy, unlike
 * api/content.ts. That is correct here and worth saying: artwork is somebody
 * else's work, a fixed wall of it goes stale in a way that a channel's own upload
 * list does not, and an empty answer here is far more likely to be the source
 * being unavailable than the page genuinely having no art. So the response says
 * `reason: unavailable` and the UI offers the X search, which is always reachable,
 * rather than showing an empty wall as though it were the answer.
 *
 * Images
 * ------
 * Nitter proxies every image through its own host as
 * /pic/media%2F<name>.jpg, which dies with the instance. The name is the same
 * path segment pbs.twimg.com uses, so the URL is rebuilt against Twitter's image
 * host — verified byte-identical to the proxied copy, and it outlives whichever
 * Nitter instance happens to be up today.

/**
 * Nitter instances, tried in order.
 *
 * This list is longer than it used to be, and not for tidiness: two of these were
 * enough while the kabii pair carried both routes, and now the fanart route gets
 * an empty feed from both. The tweets route still reads twenty posts through
 * nitter1.kabii.moe from the same address, so the instance is not down -- it is
 * answering the profile route and returning nothing for the hashtag search.
 *
 * That is why more instances rather than a retry: two hosts agreeing that a search
 * is empty is information, and hitting the same host twice is not. Each is tried
 * once, in order, and the first that returns a parseable feed with entries in it
 * wins.
 *
 * Measured from this machine while diagnosing, all of them refusing for their own
 * reasons, which is the normal state of a list like this:
 *
 *   nitter1.kabii.moe    HTTP 429   rate limited
 *   nitter.kabii.moe     HTTP 429   rate limited
 *   nitter.net           refused
 *   xcancel.com          HTTP 451   unavailable for legal reasons
 *   nitter.poast.org     no DNS
 *   nitter.space         HTTP 403
 *   nitter.tiekoetter.com HTTP 200, feed empty
 *   nitter.catsarch.com  HTTP 503
 *
 * The rate limits are per address, so which of these answers differs between a
 * laptop and a serverless IP. That is the reason to keep several rather than to
 * pick the best one.
