/*
 * GET /api/fanart?cursor=<opaque>
 *
 * Art posted by other people, found by hashtag.
 *
 * Why this reads Nitter's HTML and not its RSS feed
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * The RSS feed used to be the whole route, and it returned four items. That was
 * never a limit anyone set -- it is simply how much a search feed gives back, and
 * the rest of the results live behind the "load more" link at the foot of the
 * HTML page as a `cursor=` parameter. The RSS endpoint answers 404 when handed
 * that cursor, so a feed-only route cannot paginate at all: the cursor has to
 * come from the HTML view, and once you are reading HTML anyway there is no
 * reason to also ask for the feed.
 *
 * Measured against the live instance, one hashtag went from 4 items to 123.
 *
 * What the HTML gives that the feed did not
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Engagement counts. The RSS omits likes, replies, reposts and views entirely;
 * the page markup carries all four, so the cards can show them for the first
 * time. Retweet state is there too, which is how a repost of somebody else's
 * artwork is told apart from an artist posting their own.
 *
 * Cursor
 * ------
 * Opaque and instance-specific, so it is passed back untouched rather than
 * rebuilt. Nitter reissues a different cursor on every page, so it must be read
 * off the page just fetched -- there is no arithmetic that produces the next one.
 *
 * Budget
 * ------
 * Pages are walked up to a limit and the walk stops the moment the instance
 * answers 429. That is not hypothetical: sequential paging trips the rate limit
 * on these instances, so a first load asks for four pages and a "load more"
 * asks for one. A partial result is still a result, and the cursor to continue
 * from survives even when the walk was cut short.

 * The instance pool, measured rather than accumulated.
 *
 * Seventeen hosts were probed for this route. Only two answer a hashtag search
 * with actual results and a next-page cursor:
 *
 *   nitter1.kabii.moe   200, items + cursor
 *   nitter.kabii.moe    200, items + cursor
 *
 * The rest are gone or useless for a search: nitter.net, nitter.poast.org,
 * nitter.woodland.cafe, nitter.7shiro.com, nitter.esmailelbob.xyz,
 * nitter.nerdvpn.de, nitter.materialio.us, nitter.privacydev.net, nitter.1d4.us
 * and nitter.privacy.com.de no longer resolve; nitter.kuuro.net and
 * nitter.privacyredirect.com answer 404; xcancel.com answers 451;
 * nitter.space 403; nitter.catsarch.com 503; nitter.adminforge.de 404; and
 * nitter.tiekoetter.com returns 200 with zero results because search is disabled
 * there.
 *
 * Two of the four sites previously carried eight hosts each. Keeping them was
 * not free: an unusable host is not a free fallback, it is up to three seconds
 * of timeout before the walk reaches the one that works. So the pool is two,
 * both proven.
 *
 * That is thin, and it is a genuine single point of failure -- both are the same
 * operator and likely share one rate limit. It is why the walk is paced and
 * retried rather than fired as fast as it can go, and why a partial result is
 * preferred over an empty page.
