/**
 * GET /api/content
 *
 * Serves three lists from the channel plus the search index, read fresh on every
 * cold request:
 *
 *   streams  the /streams tab, newest broadcast first
 *   videos   the /videos tab, newest upload first, broadcasts excluded
 *   clips    videos from other channels whose title or description names her
 *
 * Why these three sources and not the obvious ones:
 *
 * 1. The absolute broadcast start is `liveBroadcastDetails.startTimestamp` on
 *    the watch page, and it is the only honest source for it. The RSS
 *    `published` field is not: that is when the archive went up, which runs 2 to
 *    13 hours after the broadcast began and can land on a different calendar
 *    day. Measured on four videos: 2.3h, 4.2h, 7.1h and 13.5h late.
 *
 * 2. The watch page cannot be read from a serverless IP. YouTube answers with
 *    HTTP 200 and 1.27 MB of page, but `liveBroadcastDetails` is absent and the
 *    document trips bot detection. Verified across three hosts and six
 *    strategies, all failing the same way:
 *
 *      | target                          | result                              |
 *      |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 *      | watch page, Vercel              | 200, no liveBroadcastDetails        |
 *      | watch page, Cloudflare Worker   | 200, no liveBroadcastDetails        |
 *      | InnerTube WEB                   | LOGIN_REQUIRED, "confirm not a bot" |
 *      | InnerTube TVHTML5               | LOGIN_REQUIRED, same                |
 *      | InnerTube ANDROID / IOS         | HTTP 400                            |
 *      | tab /streams, Vercel            | 200, parses fine                    |
 *
 *    So no card claims a start time. Ages come from YouTube's own labels, which
 *    the /streams and search pages both carry.
 *
 * 3. The three tabs read three different surfaces because none of them carries
 *    the others' content. The /streams tab lists broadcasts and nothing else,
 *    the /videos tab lists uploads and nothing else, and neither mentions a
 *    clipper. Only the search results page mixes all three, which is what makes
 *    it the right place to look for clips.
 *
 * Ten searches are read for the clips rather than one, because a single query is
 * not a measure of how many clips exist. YouTube ranks by relevance to the
 * phrasing it was given, so one query mostly returns whichever slice of the web
 * matches those words -- that was measured on the sibling site, where a bare
 * handle query returned mostly the character's own channel and a cartoon about
 * them rather than clips.
 *
 * Six queries was still not enough, which is the harder finding: measured over
 * three passes, a single pass with six queries surfaced 8, 9 and 7 of the
 * nineteen clips any pass could find, and never all of them. So a cold response
 * could be missing the newest clip on the page. Ten queries brings a pass to
 * 15, 13 and 14 of nineteen. See SEARCH_QUERIES.
 *
 * The clips filter is deliberately narrow: another channel's video counts only
 * when her name is in the title or the description snippet. A search for a common
 * given name returns plenty of unrelated videos, so this leans on the word
 * boundary - measured on the sibling site, not assumed: a bare substring test
 * there pulled a Fisher-Price toy video titled "Family Time with Pingu" into the
 * clip wall, because Pingu is also a children's cartoon and a Penguin-of-Africa
 * brand. "Sierra Mooniva" carries no such collision, but the boundary is kept
 * because it costs nothing and the failure it prevents is silent.
 *
 * It is still a best effort rather than an exact match. A toy video carrying
 * only the brand name in its title would still slip through, which is why the
 * page presents the clip wall as best effort instead of claiming completeness.
 * Her own uploads are excluded, since those are already in the other two tabs.

/**
 * Six searches instead of one, because one is not enough.

 * clips that any pass could find:
 *
 *   query set       pass 1   pass 2   pass 3   union
 *   6 queries         8/19     9/19     7/19     11/19

 * queries surfaced 8, 9 and 7 of nineteen clips across three passes, ten brought
 * a pass to 15, 13 and 14, and only the union of ten ever saw all nineteen. The
 * shape of that finding is about the search, not about the person -- one query is
 * not a measure of a channel's clips whatever the channel is called -- so the
 * count carries over. The pool it is being applied to did not.
 *
 * What has NOT been done here: no pass was measured against Sierra's channel.
 * Her uploads are covers, and a clip of a cover is a different shape of thing
 * from a clip of a stream. The wall below can legitimately come back empty, and
 * SNAPSHOT_CLIPS in src/lib/useContent.ts is empty for the same reason rather than
 * carrying another creator's list. Measuring the ten against her channel is
 * follow-up work, and until it happens the number in this comment describes the
 * sibling sites only.
 *
 * The queries themselves overlap heavily -- her name, her handle, her hashtag, and
 * the genres she actually posts in -- so the union is deduplicated by video id.
